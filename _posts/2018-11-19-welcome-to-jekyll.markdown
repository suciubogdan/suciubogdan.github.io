I decided to give [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a try for my first blog. It was recommended by a friend a few months ago and I found it interesting. I will also be using [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from GitHub as the first iteration of this blog to postpone the choice of what to use as a web server.
I often find myself stuck because of too many options and I decided to work on this and to just pick something. It does not mean I cannot change my mind later. I have seen this affecting others so I will try to set an example and put something out there that is not perfectly refined but something that can grow over time and speed up my learning while doing it.
It's easy to preach to others that something is better than nothing, but then you try to follow your own advice and see that it's not always that easy as it seems from the outside.
